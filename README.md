# In Development [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shakna-israel/doccu.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/shakna-israel/doccu)

Doccu is still being defined, let alone built.

If you happen to find some Python files here, I would strongly reccomend you do not use them.

This is a commercially commissioned project, in the earliest days of development.

## Provisioning

Doccu uses *Vagrant*, so launching is as simple as:

```
git clone https://github.com/shakna-israel/doccu.git
git checkout Vagrantfile
vagrant up
```
