# Doccu

## The Documentation Engine

---

Doccu is still under major development, and is not ready for any sort of use.

Even when ready, Doccu does not gurantee any sort of security, this is for internal use only, where you can implicitly trust your users.

---

Doccu is managed via the Management Console, completely.

To run Doccu, simply open the Management Console:

```
python doccu-manage.py
```

And follow the prompts.

Documentation is currently under development.
